    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Techincal Troubleshooting</li>
        <li>Quality Assurance</li>
        <li>Process Optimization</li>
        <li>CAD/CAM Software</li>
        <li>System Maintenance</li>
        <li>Client Communication</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Technical Aptitude & Working with Complex Systems</li>
        <p>Experience Gained:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Operating Digital Manufacturing Hardware (3D Printers): "3D Selective Laser Melting - running, operation and maintenance of multiple machines." This is not simple machine operation; SLM printers are complex systems that require calibration, monitoring, and an understanding of digital-to-physical workflows.</li>
        <li>Using Specialized Software (CAD/CAM): "E-Max ceramics CAD/CAM order nesting." This demonstrates direct experience with Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing software. "Nesting" is an optimization process, showing an understanding of efficiency and resource management within a software environment.</li>
        <li>System Maintenance and Upkeep: "SLM & E-Max machines upkeep and maintenance." This is equivalent to IT hardware support—diagnosing issues, performing routine checks, and ensuring systems are operational. This is a core skill for roles in IT support, DevOps, or systems administration.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Process, Precision, and Workflow Management</li>
        <p>Experience Gained:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Following Technical Specifications: "Masking and unmasking components instructed by an engineer drawing." This is analogous to a developer taking a technical specification or a user story and implementing it exactly as required.</li>
        <li>Adherence to Complex Procedures: The entire paint spraying role (polyurethane topcoats, lacquers, primers, etc.) involves multi-step processes where the order and method of application are critical to the final product's success. This mirrors following a deployment pipeline or a testing protocol.</li>
        <li>Order Fulfillment: "Order fulfillment and quality check" shows an understanding of the entire lifecycle of a task, from receiving a request (the order) to delivering a finished, verified product. This is the essence of a development sprint or a support ticket lifecycle.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Attention to Detail & Quality Assurance (QA)</li>
        <p>Experience Gained:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Meticulous Inspection: "Quality check" is mentioned in two different high-stakes manufacturing roles. The candidate is trained to spot imperfections and ensure the final product meets exacting standards. This is a perfect foundation for a QA Engineer, Tester, or a developer who writes clean, bug-free code.</li>
        <li>Working with Intricate Components: "Paint spraying of complex components" and "Metal finishing" on dental units requires a high degree of precision and focus. One small mistake could ruin the entire piece. This is the same mindset required when debugging complex code or configuring a sensitive server.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting</li>
        <p>Experience Gained:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Hardware Troubleshooting: "machines upkeep and maintenance" implies identifying and resolving issues with the 3D printers and CNC machines. Did a job fail? Was there a material clog? This is hands-on troubleshooting.</li>
        <li>Client and Service Coordination: As a Lettings Administrator, "Arranging for maintenance to be carried out, liaising with landlords" is a form of incident management. It involves identifying a problem (e.g., a tenant reports a leak), assessing the situation, and coordinating resources (plumbers, landlords) to resolve it. This is directly comparable to a helpdesk or IT support role.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Communication and Client-Facing Skills</li>
        <p>Experience Gained:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Client Communication: "Taking phone calls and satisfying customer requests," "Advising clients about the letting process." This shows the ability to explain complex processes to non-technical individuals.</li>
        <li>Stakeholder Management: "Liaising with landlords" demonstrates the ability to manage expectations and communicate between different parties to achieve a goal. This is crucial when working with project managers, clients, and other developers.</li>
        <li>Multilingualism: Being fluent in three languages (Hungarian, English, Romanian) is a significant cognitive asset, demonstrating an ability to learn complex rule-based systems (like languages) and to communicate effectively with diverse teams.</li>
            </ul>
